Response:
My thinking process to answer the question about the provided `doc.go` content went through these steps:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The core request is to summarize the functionality described in the Go code comments, specifically regarding the `cgo` tool. It also asks for examples, explanation of command-line arguments, and potential pitfalls (though the provided text didn't have much on pitfalls). Crucially, it's part 2 of a 2-part explanation, so I need to focus on summarizing the current part.

2. **Break Down the Content:**  I scanned the text, identifying key sections and concepts. The main themes I noticed were:

    * **File Structure and Compilation Products:**  The description of `_go_.o`, `_all.o`, `_cgo_gotypes.go`, etc., and how `cgo` generates these.
    * **Internal vs. External Linking:** This is a central concept, so I paid close attention to the differences and the conditions under which each is used.
    * **Linking Directives (`//go:cgo_*`)**: The purpose and syntax of these directives are crucial for understanding how `cgo` communicates with the linker.
    * **Runtime Considerations:** The variables `iscgo`, `_cgo_init`, `_cgo_thread_start` and their role were noted.
    * **`cmd/link` Command Line:**  The flags like `-linkmode`, `-extld`, and `-extldflags` are important for controlling the linking process.
    * **Example:** The `sin` example provides a concrete illustration of how the different linking modes and directives work.

3. **Identify the Core Functionality (Part 2 Focus):** Given this is part 2, I realized the emphasis shifted from the *basic* setup and compilation to the *linking* process. The content focuses heavily on how `cgo` interacts with the linker (`cmd/link`) in both internal and external modes. The directives are the key mechanism for this interaction.

4. **Summarize the Main Functionality:** Based on the breakdown, I formulated the main function of this part as explaining *how `cgo` bridges the gap between Go and C code during the linking process*. This involves:

    * Generating specific object files (`_go_.o`, `_all.o`).
    * Using internal and external linking modes to handle different scenarios.
    * Employing special `//go:cgo_*` directives to communicate linking instructions.
    * Coordinating with the `cmd/link` tool, either directly or by invoking the host linker.

5. **Address Specific Requests:**

    * **Functionality Listing:** I made a list of the core functionalities identified above.
    * **Go Code Example:** The provided example about `C.sin` is already a good illustration. I reiterated its purpose in showing the difference between internal and external linking. I didn't need to create a new example, as the existing one was relevant.
    * **Assumptions, Inputs, Outputs (for Code):**  For the `sin` example, I noted the implicit assumption that the math library (`-lm`) is available and pointed out the different outputs (dynamic linking in internal mode, static linking in external mode).
    * **Command Line Arguments:**  I extracted the key `cmd/link` flags (`-linkmode`, `-extld`, `-extldflags`) and explained their purpose.
    * **Potential Pitfalls:** The text doesn't explicitly mention common errors. I acknowledged this by saying the text doesn't cover them.
    * **Part 2 Summary:** I specifically focused on summarizing the linking aspects discussed in this section, reiterating the internal/external modes and the role of directives.

6. **Structure the Answer:** I organized the answer logically, starting with the main function, then addressing each specific request with clear headings and explanations. I used formatting (like bolding) to highlight key points.

7. **Refine and Review:**  I reread my answer and compared it to the original text to ensure accuracy and completeness. I checked for any jargon that might be unclear and tried to explain things in a straightforward way. For instance, I made sure to explain what internal and external linking *mean* in the context of `cgo`.

By following these steps, I could systematically analyze the provided text and generate a comprehensive and accurate answer to the user's request. The key was to break down the complex information into smaller, manageable parts and then synthesize them into a coherent summary.
这是 `go/src/cmd/cgo/doc.go` 文件中关于 `cgo` 工具功能描述的第二部分，主要聚焦于 **cgo 如何在链接阶段工作，以及 `cmd/link` 工具在处理 cgo 代码时的行为**。

**归纳一下它的功能:**

这部分文档主要描述了 `cgo` 在链接阶段的处理机制，包括：

* **生成的中间文件:** 解释了 `cgo` 生成的 `.o` 文件 (`_go_.o`, `_all.o`) 的作用以及它们包含的内容。
* **内部链接和外部链接:**  详细解释了 `cgo` 支持的两种链接模式，以及它们各自的特点和适用场景。
    * **内部链接:** `cmd/link` 直接处理 host object files (例如 `.o` 文件)，但能力有限，主要用于简单的 cgo 场景。
    * **外部链接:** `cmd/link` 将 Go 代码打包成 `go.o` 文件，然后调用 host linker (通常是 gcc 或 clang) 来完成最终的链接，适用于更复杂的 cgo 场景。
* **链接指令 (`//go:cgo_*`):**  详细介绍了用于在 Go 代码中指示 `cmd/link` 如何处理 cgo 相关链接的各种指令，包括动态和静态导入导出，以及传递链接器参数。
* **`cmd/link` 的命令行接口:**  解释了 `cmd/link` 工具在处理 cgo 代码时的默认行为，以及如何通过命令行参数来控制链接模式和使用的 host linker。
* **运行时支持:**  简要提及了 `runtime/cgo` 包提供的运行时支持，例如初始化 `iscgo` 变量和线程管理。

**更详细的功能点:**

1. **区分内部和外部链接，并根据情况选择合适的模式:**  `cgo` 的设计目标之一是在不需要外部工具（如 gcc）的情况下，也能链接包含少量 cgo 代码的程序（例如只依赖 libc）。因此，`cgo` 实现了内部链接模式。但为了支持更复杂的 cgo 场景，也提供了外部链接模式。`cmd/link` 会根据项目中的 cgo 包情况自动选择链接模式，也可以通过命令行参数强制指定。

2. **通过链接指令与 `cmd/link` 沟通:**  `cgo` 使用特殊的 `//go:cgo_*` 注释作为链接指令，告诉 `cmd/link` 如何处理 C 代码的符号导入导出、动态链接库依赖以及传递额外的链接器参数。这些指令会被嵌入到 `.o` 文件中，供 `cmd/link` 解析。

3. **支持动态链接和静态链接:**  通过 `//go:cgo_import_dynamic` 和 `//go:cgo_import_static` 指令，`cgo` 可以分别处理动态链接库的符号导入和静态库的符号导入。

4. **允许 Go 代码暴露符号给 C 代码:**  `//go:cgo_export_dynamic` 和 `//go:cgo_export_static` 指令允许将 Go 函数或变量的符号导出，以便 C 代码可以调用 Go 代码。

5. **简化 `cmd/link` 的实现:**  通过区分内部和外部链接模式，以及利用 host linker 的能力，`cgo` 使得 Go 的链接器 `cmd/link` 可以保持相对简单，不需要实现完整的 ELF 或 Mach-O 链接器的功能。

**Go 代码举例说明 (基于文档中的 `sin` 函数示例):**

假设我们有以下 Go 代码 `foo.go` 使用 cgo 调用 C 语言的 `sin` 函数：

```go
package main

//#include <math.h>
import "C"
import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 1.0
	y := C.sin(C.double(x))
	fmt.Println(y)
}
```

当使用 `go build foo.go` 构建时，`cgo` 会生成一些中间文件，包括：

* `_cgo_defun.c`: 包含 C 桥接函数的定义，例如调用 `sin` 的函数。
* `_cgo_gotypes.go`:  包含 Go 类型和 C 类型的转换定义。
* `foo.cgo2.c`:  经过 GCC 编译后的 C 代码，包含对 `sin` 函数的调用。

并且会在生成的 Go 代码中包含链接指令，例如：

```go
// compiled by gc

//go:cgo_ldflag "-lm"

type _Ctype_double float64

//go:cgo_import_static _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin
//go:linkname __cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin
var __cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin byte
var _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin = unsafe.Pointer(&__cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin)

func _Cfunc_sin(p0 _Ctype_double) (r1 _Ctype_double) {
	_cgo_runtime_cgocall(_cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&p0)))
	return
}
```

**假设的输入与输出:**

* **输入:** `foo.go` 文件，包含调用 C `sin` 函数的代码。
* **构建命令:** `go build foo.go`
* **输出 (取决于链接模式):**
    * **内部链接:**  生成的 `foo` 可执行文件会动态链接 `libm.so.6` (或其他系统提供的 math 库)。`cmd/link` 会解析 `foo.cgo2.o`，发现对 `sin` 的未定义引用，并根据 `//go:cgo_import_dynamic` 指令将其重定向到动态库中的符号。
    * **外部链接:** 生成的 `foo` 可执行文件可能静态链接了 math 库（取决于系统配置和 `-lm` 的具体行为），或者仍然是动态链接。 `cmd/link` 生成 `go.o` 文件时，会标记 `_cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin` 为未定义的静态符号，并根据 `//go:cgo_ldflag "-lm"` 指令告诉 host linker 在链接时包含 math 库。

**命令行参数的具体处理:**

`cmd/link` 接受以下与 cgo 相关的命令行参数：

* **`-linkmode=internal` 或 `-linkmode=external`:** 强制指定链接模式。如果未指定，`cmd/link` 会根据项目中的 cgo 包情况自动选择。
    * **场景:**  当你需要明确控制链接行为时使用，例如强制使用外部链接来链接包含复杂 C 依赖的库，或者强制使用内部链接来避免依赖外部工具。
* **`-extld=<path>`:** 指定要使用的 host linker 的路径。默认为 `$CC` 或 `gcc`。
    * **场景:** 当你需要使用特定的编译器 (例如 clang) 作为 host linker 时使用。
* **`-extldflags='<flags>'`:** 指定传递给 host linker 的额外命令行参数。
    * **场景:**  当你需要传递特定的链接器标志，例如库路径 (`-L`) 或需要链接的库 (`-l`) 时使用。

**总结:**

`go/src/cmd/cgo/doc.go` 的这一部分详细阐述了 `cgo` 如何在链接阶段与 Go 的链接器 `cmd/link` 协同工作，通过内部和外部链接模式以及特殊的链接指令，实现了 Go 代码与 C 代码的无缝集成，并解释了 `cmd/link` 工具在处理 cgo 代码时的行为和可配置性。 这使得开发者能够构建既能利用 Go 的强大功能，又能调用 C 代码以访问底层系统资源或利用现有 C 库的应用程序。

"""
ead.so.0"
	//go:cgo_import_dynamic _ _ "libc.so.6"

In the end, the compiled Go package, which will eventually be
presented to cmd/link as part of a larger program, contains:

	_go_.o        # gc-compiled object for _cgo_gotypes.go, _cgo_import.go, *.cgo1.go
	_all.o        # gcc-compiled object for _cgo_export.c, *.cgo2.c

If there is an error generating the _cgo_import.go file, then, instead
of adding _cgo_import.go to the package, the go tool adds an empty
file named dynimportfail. The _cgo_import.go file is only needed when
using internal linking mode, which is not the default when linking
programs that use cgo (as described below). If the linker sees a file
named dynimportfail it reports an error if it has been told to use
internal linking mode. This approach is taken because generating
_cgo_import.go requires doing a full C link of the package, which can
fail for reasons that are irrelevant when using external linking mode.

The final program will be a dynamic executable, so that cmd/link can avoid
needing to process arbitrary .o files. It only needs to process the .o
files generated from C files that cgo writes, and those are much more
limited in the ELF or other features that they use.

In essence, the _cgo_import.o file includes the extra linking
directives that cmd/link is not sophisticated enough to derive from _all.o
on its own. Similarly, the _all.o uses dynamic references to real
system object code because cmd/link is not sophisticated enough to process
the real code.

The main benefits of this system are that cmd/link remains relatively simple
(it does not need to implement a complete ELF and Mach-O linker) and
that gcc is not needed after the package is compiled. For example,
package net uses cgo for access to name resolution functions provided
by libc. Although gcc is needed to compile package net, gcc is not
needed to link programs that import package net.

Runtime

When using cgo, Go must not assume that it owns all details of the
process. In particular it needs to coordinate with C in the use of
threads and thread-local storage. The runtime package declares a few
variables:

	var (
		iscgo             bool
		_cgo_init         unsafe.Pointer
		_cgo_thread_start unsafe.Pointer
	)

Any package using cgo imports "runtime/cgo", which provides
initializations for these variables. It sets iscgo to true, _cgo_init
to a gcc-compiled function that can be called early during program
startup, and _cgo_thread_start to a gcc-compiled function that can be
used to create a new thread, in place of the runtime's usual direct
system calls.

Internal and External Linking

The text above describes "internal" linking, in which cmd/link parses and
links host object files (ELF, Mach-O, PE, and so on) into the final
executable itself. Keeping cmd/link simple means we cannot possibly
implement the full semantics of the host linker, so the kinds of
objects that can be linked directly into the binary is limited (other
code can only be used as a dynamic library). On the other hand, when
using internal linking, cmd/link can generate Go binaries by itself.

In order to allow linking arbitrary object files without requiring
dynamic libraries, cgo supports an "external" linking mode too. In
external linking mode, cmd/link does not process any host object files.
Instead, it collects all the Go code and writes a single go.o object
file containing it. Then it invokes the host linker (usually gcc) to
combine the go.o object file and any supporting non-Go code into a
final executable. External linking avoids the dynamic library
requirement but introduces a requirement that the host linker be
present to create such a binary.

Most builds both compile source code and invoke the linker to create a
binary. When cgo is involved, the compile step already requires gcc, so
it is not problematic for the link step to require gcc too.

An important exception is builds using a pre-compiled copy of the
standard library. In particular, package net uses cgo on most systems,
and we want to preserve the ability to compile pure Go code that
imports net without requiring gcc to be present at link time. (In this
case, the dynamic library requirement is less significant, because the
only library involved is libc.so, which can usually be assumed
present.)

This conflict between functionality and the gcc requirement means we
must support both internal and external linking, depending on the
circumstances: if net is the only cgo-using package, then internal
linking is probably fine, but if other packages are involved, so that there
are dependencies on libraries beyond libc, external linking is likely
to work better. The compilation of a package records the relevant
information to support both linking modes, leaving the decision
to be made when linking the final binary.

Linking Directives

In either linking mode, package-specific directives must be passed
through to cmd/link. These are communicated by writing //go: directives in a
Go source file compiled by gc. The directives are copied into the .o
object file and then processed by the linker.

The directives are:

//go:cgo_import_dynamic <local> [<remote> ["<library>"]]

	In internal linking mode, allow an unresolved reference to
	<local>, assuming it will be resolved by a dynamic library
	symbol. The optional <remote> specifies the symbol's name and
	possibly version in the dynamic library, and the optional "<library>"
	names the specific library where the symbol should be found.

	On AIX, the library pattern is slightly different. It must be
	"lib.a/obj.o" with obj.o the member of this library exporting
	this symbol.

	In the <remote>, # or @ can be used to introduce a symbol version.

	Examples:
	//go:cgo_import_dynamic puts
	//go:cgo_import_dynamic puts puts#GLIBC_2.2.5
	//go:cgo_import_dynamic puts puts#GLIBC_2.2.5 "libc.so.6"

	A side effect of the cgo_import_dynamic directive with a
	library is to make the final binary depend on that dynamic
	library. To get the dependency without importing any specific
	symbols, use _ for local and remote.

	Example:
	//go:cgo_import_dynamic _ _ "libc.so.6"

	For compatibility with current versions of SWIG,
	#pragma dynimport is an alias for //go:cgo_import_dynamic.

//go:cgo_dynamic_linker "<path>"

	In internal linking mode, use "<path>" as the dynamic linker
	in the final binary. This directive is only needed from one
	package when constructing a binary; by convention it is
	supplied by runtime/cgo.

	Example:
	//go:cgo_dynamic_linker "/lib/ld-linux.so.2"

//go:cgo_export_dynamic <local> <remote>

	In internal linking mode, put the Go symbol
	named <local> into the program's exported symbol table as
	<remote>, so that C code can refer to it by that name. This
	mechanism makes it possible for C code to call back into Go or
	to share Go's data.

	For compatibility with current versions of SWIG,
	#pragma dynexport is an alias for //go:cgo_export_dynamic.

//go:cgo_import_static <local>

	In external linking mode, allow unresolved references to
	<local> in the go.o object file prepared for the host linker,
	under the assumption that <local> will be supplied by the
	other object files that will be linked with go.o.

	Example:
	//go:cgo_import_static puts_wrapper

//go:cgo_export_static <local> <remote>

	In external linking mode, put the Go symbol
	named <local> into the program's exported symbol table as
	<remote>, so that C code can refer to it by that name. This
	mechanism makes it possible for C code to call back into Go or
	to share Go's data.

//go:cgo_ldflag "<arg>"

	In external linking mode, invoke the host linker (usually gcc)
	with "<arg>" as a command-line argument following the .o files.
	Note that the arguments are for "gcc", not "ld".

	Example:
	//go:cgo_ldflag "-lpthread"
	//go:cgo_ldflag "-L/usr/local/sqlite3/lib"

A package compiled with cgo will include directives for both
internal and external linking; the linker will select the appropriate
subset for the chosen linking mode.

Example

As a simple example, consider a package that uses cgo to call C.sin.
The following code will be generated by cgo:

	// compiled by gc

	//go:cgo_ldflag "-lm"

	type _Ctype_double float64

	//go:cgo_import_static _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin
	//go:linkname __cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin
	var __cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin byte
	var _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin = unsafe.Pointer(&__cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin)

	func _Cfunc_sin(p0 _Ctype_double) (r1 _Ctype_double) {
		_cgo_runtime_cgocall(_cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&p0)))
		return
	}

	// compiled by gcc, into foo.cgo2.o

	void
	_cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin(void *v)
	{
		struct {
			double p0;
			double r;
		} __attribute__((__packed__)) *a = v;
		a->r = sin(a->p0);
	}

What happens at link time depends on whether the final binary is linked
using the internal or external mode. If other packages are compiled in
"external only" mode, then the final link will be an external one.
Otherwise the link will be an internal one.

The linking directives are used according to the kind of final link
used.

In internal mode, cmd/link itself processes all the host object files, in
particular foo.cgo2.o. To do so, it uses the cgo_import_dynamic and
cgo_dynamic_linker directives to learn that the otherwise undefined
reference to sin in foo.cgo2.o should be rewritten to refer to the
symbol sin with version GLIBC_2.2.5 from the dynamic library
"libm.so.6", and the binary should request "/lib/ld-linux.so.2" as its
runtime dynamic linker.

In external mode, cmd/link does not process any host object files, in
particular foo.cgo2.o. It links together the gc-generated object
files, along with any other Go code, into a go.o file. While doing
that, cmd/link will discover that there is no definition for
_cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin, referred to by the gc-compiled source file. This
is okay, because cmd/link also processes the cgo_import_static directive and
knows that _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin is expected to be supplied by a host
object file, so cmd/link does not treat the missing symbol as an error when
creating go.o. Indeed, the definition for _cgo_gcc_Cfunc_sin will be
provided to the host linker by foo2.cgo.o, which in turn will need the
symbol 'sin'. cmd/link also processes the cgo_ldflag directives, so that it
knows that the eventual host link command must include the -lm
argument, so that the host linker will be able to find 'sin' in the
math library.

cmd/link Command Line Interface

The go command and any other Go-aware build systems invoke cmd/link
to link a collection of packages into a single binary. By default, cmd/link will
present the same interface it does today:

	cmd/link main.a

produces a file named a.out, even if cmd/link does so by invoking the host
linker in external linking mode.

By default, cmd/link will decide the linking mode as follows: if the only
packages using cgo are those on a list of known standard library
packages (net, os/user, runtime/cgo), cmd/link will use internal linking
mode. Otherwise, there are non-standard cgo packages involved, and cmd/link
will use external linking mode. The first rule means that a build of
the godoc binary, which uses net but no other cgo, can run without
needing gcc available. The second rule means that a build of a
cgo-wrapped library like sqlite3 can generate a standalone executable
instead of needing to refer to a dynamic library. The specific choice
can be overridden using a command line flag: cmd/link -linkmode=internal or
cmd/link -linkmode=external.

In an external link, cmd/link will create a temporary directory, write any
host object files found in package archives to that directory (renamed
to avoid conflicts), write the go.o file to that directory, and invoke
the host linker. The default value for the host linker is $CC, split
into fields, or else "gcc". The specific host linker command line can
be overridden using command line flags: cmd/link -extld=clang
-extldflags='-ggdb -O3'. If any package in a build includes a .cc or
other file compiled by the C++ compiler, the go tool will use the
-extld option to set the host linker to the C++ compiler.

These defaults mean that Go-aware build systems can ignore the linking
changes and keep running plain 'cmd/link' and get reasonable results, but
they can also control the linking details if desired.
